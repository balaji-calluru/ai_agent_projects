        "1. The Environment: The world the Agent lives in (in our case, the CartPole game).\n",
        "2. The Action: A move the Agent can make (e.g., push the cart left or right).\n",

        "\n",
        "The Agent's only goal is to maximize its total reward over time. It does this by learning a policy, a strategy for choosing the best action in any given situation. This learning process is called **Reinforcement Learning**.\n"

        "2. **Deciding a Move**: To choose an action, the Agent uses an **epsilon-greedy strategy**. Most of the time, it **exploits** its knowledge by picking the action its network predicts is best. But sometimes (controlled by a value called epsilon), it **explores** by taking a random action to discover potentially better strategies. Early on, the Agent explores a lot, but as it gets smarter, epsilon decreases, and it relies more on what it has learned.\n",
        "3. **Getting Smarter**: This is the core of the learning process. The Agent compares the Q-value its network expects for an action with a more accurate target Q-value calculated from the actual reward and outcome. The difference between the expected and target values is the loss. The Agent then updates its network to minimize this loss, slowly making its predictions closer to reality.\n",
