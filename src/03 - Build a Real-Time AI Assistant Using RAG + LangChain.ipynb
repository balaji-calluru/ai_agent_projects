    "## Step 2: Understanding RAG - Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a technique that combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge source (web, documents, databases)\n",
    "2. **Augmentation**: Enhancing the LLM prompt with retrieved context  \n",
    "3. **Generation**: Using LLMs to generate responses based on the augmented context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ❌ **LLMs have knowledge cutoffs** - They don't know recent events\n",
    "- ❌ **LLMs can hallucinate** - They make up information\n",
    "- ✅ **RAG grounds responses** - Uses real, verifiable sources\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Flow Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Question \n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Search/Retrieve (DuckDuckGo)\n",

    "LLM Generates Answer\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Response to User\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LangChain?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangChain** provides:\n",
    "- **Chains**: Composable sequences of operations\n",
    "- **Tools**: Integrations with external systems (search, databases, APIs)\n",
    "- **Memory**: Conversation history management\n",
    "- **LCEL**: Pythonic syntax using pipe operator (`|`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LCEL?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)** uses Python's pipe operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = step1 | step2 | step3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to: `result = step3(step2(step1(input)))`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- ✅ Readable and intuitive\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to debug\n",
    "- ✅ Supports streaming, batching, and async\n",
