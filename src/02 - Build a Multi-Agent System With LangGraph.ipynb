    "# Build a Multi-Agent System With LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "The future of AI isn't about building a smarter chatbot; it's about building a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will build that team using LangGraph. We will create a Multi-Agent System where one AI agent acts as a Researcher (browsing the web), and another acts as a Writer (synthesising that info). They will pass work to each other like colleagues in a newsroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a student or a developer looking to break into the Agentic Workflow space, this is the perfect starting point. Let's dive in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the core concepts of LangGraph and multi-agent systems\n",
    "- Build a state-based workflow with multiple AI agents\n",
    "- Integrate external tools (web search) with LLMs\n",
    "- Create a production-ready multi-agent system with error handling\n",
    "- Visualize and debug agent workflows\n",
    "- Extend the system with additional agents or capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources and Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangGraph Documentation**: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/\n",
    "- **LangChain Documentation**: https://python.langchain.com/\n",

    "## What is LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we write code, let's understand what we are building. Imagine a relay race. Runner A has the baton (data). They run their lap (task) and then pass the baton to Runner B. Runner B cannot start until they receive the baton.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph** allows us to code this relay race. It's a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. Think of it as a way to create workflows where AI agents can collaborate, make decisions, and pass information between each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nodes**: These are the agents or functions (The Runners). Each node performs a specific task and can read/write to the shared state.\n",
    "- **Edges**: These are the rules of who goes next (The Track). They define the flow of execution between nodes.\n",
    "- **State**: This is the shared memory (The Baton). It's a TypedDict that all nodes can access and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of one giant prompt, we break the logic into small, reliable steps. This approach offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity**: Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility\n",
    "2. **Debugging**: You can inspect the state at each step\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents or modify existing ones\n",
    "4. **Reliability**: Errors in one agent don't crash the entire system\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is ideal for:\n",
    "- Multi-step reasoning tasks\n",
    "- Agentic workflows with decision points\n",
    "- Systems requiring state management\n",
    "- Complex applications that need to coordinate multiple LLM calls\n",

    "## The Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep this accessible and free, we are going to use Ollama to run a local LLM (Llama 3). This means you don't need an OpenAI API key to follow along, though you will need a decent internet connection for the search tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Python Installation**\n",
    "- Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed\n",
    "- Check your version: `python --version` or `python3 --version`\n",
    "- Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Ollama Installation**\n",
    "- Download Ollama from: https://ollama.com/\n",
    "- Install it on your system\n",
    "- Verify installation: `ollama --version`\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Pull the Llama 3 Model**\n",
    "- Open your terminal and run: `ollama pull llama3`\n",
    "- This will download the model (approximately 4.7GB)\n",
    "- Verify: `ollama list` should show `llama3`\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Install Python Dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a virtual environment (highly recommended):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Install required packages:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install langgraph langchain langchain-community langchain-core langchain-ollama duckduckgo-search\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative: Using OpenAI or Other LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to use OpenAI or other cloud-based LLMs, you can replace `ChatOllama` with:\n",
    "- `ChatOpenAI` from `langchain_openai` (requires API key)\n",
    "- `ChatAnthropic` from `langchain_anthropic` (requires API key)\n",
    "- Other providers supported by LangChain\n",

    "### Step 1: Defining the Shared State\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the AgentState as a shared clipboard that hangs on the office wall. Every agent can read from it and write to it. This ensures that when the Researcher finds something, the Writer can actually see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why TypedDict?**\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Python's type checker can validate your code\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Clear contract of what data is available\n",
    "- **IDE Support**: Better autocomplete and error detection\n",
    "- **Runtime Validation**: LangGraph uses this to ensure state consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Each field in the state can be read by any node\n",
    "- Nodes return dictionaries with only the fields they want to update\n",
    "- LangGraph automatically merges updates into the state\n",
    "- The state persists throughout the entire workflow execution\n",

      "The Future of AI Agents: Revolutionizing Automation\n",
      "\n",
      "As AI agents become increasingly prevalent in various industries, one question remains: what's next? According to Kirby and Marc Escobosa, VP of Salesforce Futures, the future is bright for agentic AI, particularly as it pertains to small and medium-sized businesses. With the rise of AI-powered automation, these organizations will soon rely on AI agents – whether in the form of chatbots, virtual assistants, or autonomous execution – to streamline operations and stay competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamentals of AI agents are simple: they're intelligent systems that can perform tasks independently, often mimicking human behavior. This agentic approach is poised to transform businesses as we know it, enabling seamless communication between humans and machines. With the ability to handle complex tasks, make decisions, and learn from data, AI agents will revolutionize the way companies operate.\n",
      "\n",
      "While some may wonder about the feasibility of implementing agentic AI for small and medium-sized businesses, Escobosa's predictions suggest that even these organizations can benefit from this technology in the not-so-distant future. As the landscape continues to evolve, one thing is clear: AI agents are here to stay, and their impact will be felt across industries and economies alike.\n",

    "1. **Editor Agent**: Reviews and improves the blog post\n",
    "2. **Fact-Checker Agent**: Validates claims against research\n",
    "3. **SEO Agent**: Optimizes content for search engines\n",
    "4. **Summarizer Agent**: Creates a summary version\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling and Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "For production systems, consider:\n",
    "- Adding retry logic for failed operations\n",
    "- Implementing state persistence\n",
    "- Adding monitoring and logging\n",
    "- Creating fallback mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Routing\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def should_continue(state):\n",
    "    if len(state[\"research_data\"]) > 0:\n",
    "        return \"Writer\"\n",

    "\n",
    "## Closing Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this is how to build a Multi-Agent System with LangGraph. Building Multi-Agent systems can feel intimidating. It requires us to stop thinking like users, prompting a box, and start thinking like managers directing a team. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity**: Break complex tasks into specialized agents\n",
    "2. **State Management**: Use TypedDict for clear data contracts\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**: Always plan for failures\n",
    "4. **Extensibility**: Design for easy addition of new agents\n",
    "5. **Testing**: Test each agent independently before integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you are no longer limited by what one neural network can hold in its context window. You are orchestrating a system that can browse, think, critique, and refine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Experiment with different agent configurations\n",
    "- Add more sophisticated routing logic\n",
    "- Integrate with databases or APIs\n",
    "- Deploy your system as a service\n",
    "- Explore LangGraph's advanced features like human-in-the-loop\n",

      "The quantum computing landscape has seen significant advancements in recent months, with a growing focus on practical applications and near-term commercial viability. According to investment and partnership data from late 2024 through November 2025, the industry is narrowing its attention toward specific hardware architectures, cloud software platforms, security technologies, and tangible use cases. This shift reflects a recognition that quantum computing's immense potential can only be harnessed by addressing fundamental challenges and scaling up existing technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers at MIT have made significant strides in evaluating the commercial feasibility of quantum materials, identifying promising candidates for scalable success. Meanwhile, trapped ion and photonics quantum systems have attracted increasing funding, alongside rising investment in cloud-based development platforms. These developments hint at a future where quantum computing becomes a tangible reality, rather than a distant promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we move forward, it's clear that the quantum computing community is prioritizing practicality over pure research. With advancements in hardware and software, as well as investments in security and commercial applications, the stage is set for meaningful breakthroughs in areas like computing, communications, and national defense. As Scientific American reports, the future of quantum computing looks bright – and we can't wait to see what's next.\n"

    "### Why TypedDict Instead of Regular Dict?\n",
    "\n",
    "TypedDict provides type hints while remaining a regular dict at runtime. This gives us:\n",
    "- **IDE Autocomplete**: Your editor knows what keys exist\n",
    "- **Type Checking**: Tools like mypy can catch errors\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Clear contract of what data is expected\n",
    "- **Runtime Safety**: LangGraph validates state structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pipe Operator (|) in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "The `|` operator chains LangChain components:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = prompt | llm\n",
    "# Equivalent to: chain = prompt.chain(llm)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a RunnableSequence that processes data through each component in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Updates in LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "When a node returns a dictionary, LangGraph automatically merges it with the existing state:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Node returns:\n",
    "return {\"research_data\": [\"new data\"]}\n",
    "\n",
    "# LangGraph merges with existing state:\n",
    "# Old state: {\"topic\": \"AI\", \"research_data\": [], \"blog_post\": \"\"}\n",
    "# New state: {\"topic\": \"AI\", \"research_data\": [\"new data\"], \"blog_post\": \"\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the returned keys are updated; other keys remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our error handling follows these principles:\n",
    "1. **Fail Gracefully**: Return error messages in state rather than crashing\n",
    "2. **Log Everything**: Use logging for debugging\n",
    "3. **Validate Inputs**: Check data before processing\n",
    "4. **User-Friendly Messages**: Return clear error descriptions\n"
