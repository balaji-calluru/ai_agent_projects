            "To answer the question \"how many loans are approved?\", we need to identify the relevant column in the dataset that indicates whether a loan has been approved or not. \n",

            "### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n",
            "   - The dataset summary includes a column named `loan_paid_back`, which likely indicates whether a loan was successfully paid back. However, it does not explicitly state whether this column directly correlates with loan approval. Typically, a loan that is paid back would imply that it was approved, but we need to confirm this assumption.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Understanding the `loan_paid_back` Column**:\n",
            "   - We need to check the values in the `loan_paid_back` column. If it is a binary indicator (e.g., 1 for approved and 0 for not approved), we can use it to count the number of approved loans.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Count Approved Loans**:\n",
            "   - If `loan_paid_back` is indeed a binary indicator, we can use a simple aggregation to count the number of loans that have been paid back (i.e., approved).\n",
            "\n",
            "### Operations Needed:\n",
            "- Use Pandas to filter the dataset based on the `loan_paid_back` column.\n",
            "- Count the number of entries where `loan_paid_back` equals 1 (assuming 1 indicates an approved loan).\n",
            "\n",
            "### Example Code:\n",
            "If we were to write the code to perform this operation, it would look something like this:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",

            "# Assuming df is the DataFrame containing the dataset\n",
            "approved_loans_count = df[df['loan_paid_back'] == 1].shape[0]\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Final Answer:\n",
            "Assuming that the `loan_paid_back` column indicates loan approval, the number of loans that are approved can be determined by counting the entries where `loan_paid_back` equals 1. \n",
            "\n",
            "If the `loan_paid_back` column is not a binary indicator or does not correlate with loan approval, we would need additional information to accurately answer the question.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thus, based on the assumption that `loan_paid_back` indicates loan approval, the final answer would be:\n",
            "\n",
            "**The number of approved loans is equal to the count of entries in the `loan_paid_back` column where the value is 1.** \n",

        "### The Confusion: Budget vs. Quota vs. Rate Limits\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're seeing a **429 error** saying \"You exceeded your current quota\" but your dashboard shows **$0 used out of $5 budgeted**, you're encountering a common confusion between different types of limits:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Account Budget** (What you see in Dashboard)\n",
        "- This is your **spending limit** (e.g., $5 for January)\n",
        "- Shows how much money you've spent\n",
        "- This is **NOT** the same as quota\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **API Quota** (What causes 429 errors)\n",
        "- This is a **usage limit** separate from budget\n",
        "- Can be related to:\n",
        "  - **Account tier** (free tier has lower quotas)\n",
        "  - **Payment method** (accounts without valid payment may have restricted quotas)\n",
        "  - **Model-specific limits** (newer models like gpt-4o may have stricter quotas)\n",
        "  - **Rate limits** (requests per minute/hour)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Rate Limits** (Requests per time period)\n",
        "- How many requests you can make per minute/hour/day\n",
        "- Different for each model\n",
        "- Separate from quota and budget\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Causes of 429 \"Quota Exceeded\" Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **No Payment Method Added**\n",
        "   - Even with a budget set, if no payment method is on file, quotas are very limited\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Add a payment method in OpenAI dashboard → Billing → Payment methods\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Free Tier Limitations**\n",
        "   - Free tier accounts have very low quotas\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Upgrade to a paid plan\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model-Specific Quotas**\n",
        "   - Some models (especially newer ones like gpt-4o) have stricter quotas\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Try using `gpt-3.5-turbo` which has higher quotas\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Rate Limiting**\n",
        "   - Too many requests too quickly\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Add delays between requests, use exponential backoff\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1. Prompt Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Be Specific**: Clearly define the agent's role and capabilities\n",
        "- **Provide Context**: Give enough information without overwhelming\n",
        "- **Set Expectations**: Tell the model what format you want\n",
        "- **Use Examples**: Show the model what good responses look like\n",
        "- **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Cost Optimization\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use Appropriate Models**: Use cheaper models for simple tasks\n",
        "- **Limit Token Usage**: Set reasonable max_tokens\n",
        "- **Cache Responses**: Avoid redundant API calls\n",
        "- **Batch Processing**: Group similar queries when possible\n",
        "- **Monitor Usage**: Track your API usage regularly\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Error Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Always Use Try-Except**: Wrap API calls in error handling\n",
        "- **Implement Retries**: Use exponential backoff for transient errors\n",
        "- **Validate Inputs**: Check queries before sending to API\n",
        "- **Provide Fallbacks**: Have backup responses for errors\n",
        "- **Log Errors**: Keep track of what went wrong\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Security\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Never Commit API Keys**: Use environment variables\n",
        "- **Use .gitignore**: Exclude .env files from version control\n",
        "- **Rotate Keys**: Change API keys periodically\n",
        "- **Set Usage Limits**: Configure limits in OpenAI dashboard\n",
        "- **Monitor Access**: Check for unauthorized usage\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Optimize Prompts**: Shorter prompts = faster + cheaper\n",
        "- **Use Streaming**: For long responses, use streaming API\n",
        "- **Parallel Requests**: Process multiple queries concurrently (with rate limit awareness)\n",
        "- **Response Caching**: Cache identical queries\n"
